## Introduction
Welcome to the README for the Simple Hardhat Tutorial Project. This project is a basic introduction to using Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum that simplifies smart contract development, testing, and deployment. This repository serves as a starting point for learning about smart contract development with Hardhat.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Development**: Learn how to create and deploy a simple smart contract using Hardhat.
- **Testing**: Explore the basics of writing tests for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Deployment**: Understand the process of deploying a smart contract to a local and test Ethereum network.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) installed (`npm install hardhat`)

## Getting Started
To get started with this tutorial project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.

## Usage
This project demonstrates the following key actions:

- **Smart Contract Development**: Learn how to create and write a simple Ethereum smart contract using Solidity.
- **Testing**: Write and run tests for your smart contract to ensure its functionality.
- **Deployment**: Deploy your smart contract to a local development network.

Explore the provided code and documentation to learn more about these actions.

## Tests
To run tests for the smart contract, execute the following command:
```bash
npx hardhat test
